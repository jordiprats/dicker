# dicker - THE tool for docker you were waiting for!

best website ever: [systemadmin.es](http://systemadmin.es/)

How many times have you or someone around you have typed dicker instead of docker?
 - None?
 - A few?
 - Many?
 - Too many?
 - ...

Anyway, dicker is for you! Install it NOW

It will show dicks around your docker commands with some delay to annoy:

```bash
[root@example dicker]# dicker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
 8=============================================================================================================================================D~~~ 
```
